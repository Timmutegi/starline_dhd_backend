{
    "retention_days": 2555,  # 7 years for HIPAA
    "archive_after_days": 90,
    "enable_async_logging": True,
    "batch_size": 100,
    "sampling_rate": 100,  # 100% = log everything
    "alert_on_phi_access": True,
    "alert_on_breach": True,
    "alert_on_failed_login": True,
    "alert_email_addresses": ["admin@example.com"],
    "require_consent_verification": True,
    "mask_sensitive_data": True,
    "enable_integrity_check": True,
    "log_read_operations": True,
    "log_administrative_actions": True,
    "log_api_responses": False
}
```

### Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Audit settings
AUDIT_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
AUDIT_ASYNC_LOGGING=true
AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=2555
```

## Model Integration

### Adding Audit to Models

For PHI data models:
```python
from app.core.audit_mixins import PHIAuditMixin

class VitalsLog(PHIAuditMixin, Base):
    __tablename__ = "vitals_logs"

    # Audit configuration
    __audit_resource_type__ = "vitals"
    __audit_phi_fields__ = ["temperature", "blood_pressure", "notes"]
    __audit_exclude_fields__ = ["created_at", "updated_at"]

    # ... model fields
```

For regular data models:
```python
from app.core.audit_mixins import AuditMixin

class User(AuditMixin, Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"

    # Audit configuration
    __audit_resource_type__ = "user"
    __audit_phi_fields__ = ["email", "phone_number"]
    __audit_exclude_fields__ = ["password_hash", "created_at", "updated_at"]

    # ... model fields
```

### Manual PHI Access Logging

For read operations:
```python
from app.core.audit_mixins import log_phi_access

# When accessing PHI data
client = db.query(Client).filter(Client.id == client_id).first()
log_phi_access(client, user_id="user123", purpose="Care planning review")
```

## Email Notifications

1. **Security Breach Alert** (`security_breach_alert.html`)
   - Immediate notification of security violations
   - Detailed breach information
   - Required actions and recommendations

2. **PHI Access Alert** (`phi_access_alert.html`)
   - Notification of PHI data access
   - User and purpose tracking
   - Consent verification status

3. **Failed Login Alert** (`failed_login_alert.html`)
   - Multiple failed login attempt warnings
   - IP address and location tracking
   - Account lockout notifications

4. **Compliance Summary** (`compliance_summary.html`)

2. **Storage Space**
   - Configure automatic archiving
   - Set appropriate retention periods
   - Monitor disk usage regularly

3. **Performance Impact**
   - Use database indexes effectively
   - Optimize audit queries
   - Consider read replicas for reporting

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed audit logging:
```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('app.services.audit_service').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test with Docker (recommended)
./deploy.sh dev --build

# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test audit endpoints (requires authentication)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/audit/logs
```

### Integration Testing

The audit system is automatically tested when you:
1. Make any API calls (middleware testing)
2. Create/update models (trigger testing)
3. Access PHI data (compliance testing)

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Weekly**: Review compliance violations
2. **Monthly**: Generate compliance reports
3. **Quarterly**: Test backup and recovery
4. **Annually**: Security audit and penetration testing

### Database Maintenance

```sql
-- Check audit log volume
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM audit_logs;

-- Archive old logs (example)
INSERT INTO audit_logs_archive
SELECT * FROM audit_logs
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';

-- Clean up violations
DELETE FROM compliance_violations
WHERE status = 'resolved' AND resolved_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months';
```

## Support

For issues with the audit system:

1. Check application logs: `docker compose logs backend`
2. Review audit settings in the admin panel
3. Contact the development team with specific error messages
4. Include audit log IDs when reporting issues

## Best Practices

### For Developers
- Always use audit mixins for sensitive models
- Log PHI access manually for read operations
- Handle audit failures gracefully
- Test audit functionality thoroughly

### For Administrators
- Monitor compliance dashboards regularly
- Set up email alerts for security events
- Review user access patterns monthly
- Maintain proper backup procedures

### For Compliance Officers
- Generate regular compliance reports
- Investigate violations promptly
- Document resolution procedures
- Maintain audit trail documentation

## Conclusion

The Starline audit system provides comprehensive HIPAA-compliant logging and monitoring capabilities essential for healthcare applications. It ensures data security, regulatory compliance, and provides the transparency required for healthcare operations while maintaining system performance and usability.
